I am making a simple program (my first) to create and use, in a variety of ways, smartcards for learning any subject, starting with 'O' level economics. The cards should be printable front and back on the same card and the PC version should lead to multiple choice questions on the card material.

Suggestions for modifying scope and moving ahead are most welcome.
